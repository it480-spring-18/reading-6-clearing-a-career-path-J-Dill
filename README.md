(Bear in mind it was written in 2000!) **Answer:** Many people leaver the software testing field because it is seen as a dead-end job. It as seen as a means to an end, the end being, for example, a development job. This is all regardless of how good they actually are at testing. 
1. What are the stages in their proposed career path for testers? **Answer:** The first stage in their career path is basically a student, which they call a "software tester", and involves taking courses and going to seminars to become familiar with the core competencies. Next, they move on to a position that involves both test planning and management, along with help from a mentor or manager who acts as a guide. In these first two steps, the employee acts an a sort of student in the company. The employee then must choose a more specific path to follow, and gets the title of software test specialist. At this point, the only way to move "up" is to become involved with leading and management.
